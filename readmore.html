                My coding journey began three years ago, driven by curiosity and a desire to create. I started teaching myself programming by watching countless YouTube tutorials, immersing myself in the basics and building small projects to reinforce my learning. Eager to deepen my understanding, I enrolled in Codecademy, where I tackled JavaScript first, followed by HTML and then CSS. This structured approach gave me a solid foundation in web development.

                Today, I am a proud student at ALX Africa, where I am remastering and expanding my skills. ALX has introduced me to new tools and concepts, such as the command line, Git, and GitHub, which have become essential in my workflow. I have also learned to leverage AI as a powerful tool for productivity and creativity. Through empathy and a deep understanding of users, I strive to deliver user-friendly and impactful digital experiences.
